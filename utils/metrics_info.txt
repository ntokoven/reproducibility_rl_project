Overall, due to the high variance across
trials and random seeds of reinforcement learning algorithms,
many trials must be run with different random seeds when
comparing performance.Unless random seed selection is
explicitly part of the algorithm, averaging multiple runs over
different random seeds gives insight into the population distribution of the algorithm performance on an environment.
Similarly, due to these effects, it is important to perform
proper significance testing to determine if the higher average
returns are in fact representative of better performance

time = barplot for time (lower better) within fixed training steps
sample = see when does it converge / reaches max value, faster the better -> less runs, less samples are needed
highest, avg score = give plot and then table of results
robustness = variance in score around highest score for fully trained
